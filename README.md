# Learn how to build Python-based Web Apps with Cursor AI



This repo is the output from the [YouTube course](https://youtu.be/ESrWYoXZc8s) building a full-stack web application with English. 

Create a cutting edge and modern web app using just English. Cursor AI unlocks an amazing ability to build fast and robust applications by allowing you to speak English while it writes the code for you in a code-editing environment. 

While tools like ChatGPT and Claude have websites that make it easy to copy and paste code generated, Cursor brings these tools right next to your code for the most amazing auto-complete tool you've ever used -- far better than anything on the market yet. The best part? A lot of it costs $0 to get started for a _long time_. This entire course cost $0 in AI costs. 

What we build in this course used to cost thousands (if not tens of thousands) of dollars to build over the course of a month or two. You'll do it for free and in a little over 5 hours.

Cursor is what you thought GitHub Copilot was going to be. Heck, even if they do the same thing by the time you watch this video, you can thank Cursor for pushing the envelop and helping beginners and professional developers a like. 

Let's do this! Topics, code links, and chapters below.

Topics:

✅ Do Full Stack Web Development in pure English

✅ Leverage Anthropic's Claude.ai right on your machine without copying and pasting
